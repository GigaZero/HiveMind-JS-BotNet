HiveMind JS-BotNet

A Simple JS and PHP Botnet With Miner, written by a very nice person.

For Educational Use Only

========================

Instructions

Download Repo and upload it to your control server.

Copy bot.js and figure out a way to display it on the webpage of your choosing. Only do this with webistes you actually own

Done, you can edit cmds.php with php commands of your choice, these will be run in a hidden iframe on the target site. Also, update miner.html with your coinhive Site key so you can also make money off of the Botnet. For added security I would recomend using a Javascript Obfuscator https://javascriptobfuscator.com/Javascript-Obfuscator.aspx

========================

Usage

Can be used to conduct a DDoS Attack, it can be also used to mine Monero and preform calculations. For voluntary participants have them upload node.js to their website. Then anyone running that JavaScript file will be a willing participant in your botnet. If you navigate to /BotNet/CC/KeyLogger you can set up an experimental in-browser keylogger.

It has been proven possible to run javascript in ads so thats an idea to think about :)
